# CS102G1T2Asg - Parade Card Game
Experience the thrill of the **Parade Card Game** in three exciting modes: **Local Play**, **VS AI**, and **Online Multiplayer**! Compete with up to 6 players and prove your skills.

## Getting Started
All necessary files have been precompiled and are located in the `Classes` folder. To launch the game, simply navigate to the `CS102G1T2Asg` directory and enter the following command in your terminal:

```
run
```

## Game Modes
Each game mode follows a similar setup process. You will be prompted to either:
- Enter the number of players:
  > Select the number of players (2-6):
- Provide the player's name:
  > Enter <player> name:
- Or both, depending on the selected mode.

### Local Play
Play with friends in **Local Play Mode** by entering the number of players and assigning unique names to each participant. Duplicate player names are *not allowed*.

### Play vs AI
Challenge AI opponents with adjustable difficulty levelsâ€”including the **hardest setting, if you dare**! Compete against up to **five AI players** at once.

### Online Play
Engage in **Online Multiplayer Mode**, where you can either **host a game** or **join a local network (LAN) session**.

#### Host
As the host, a default port (`1234`) will be assigned. Simply specify the number of players to create a game lobby.

#### Join on LAN
Players can join a LAN session **only if a server is already active**. If no host is detected, the player will be redirected to the **Main Menu**.
